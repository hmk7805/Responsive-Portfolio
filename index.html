<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio. As a student attending the coding boot camp, hosted by UNC-Charlotte, I will be continuously adding to this portfolio as I learn and practice new skills. I am a passionate and driven individual who is always looking to further my experiences and skills in business and technology.

<br><br>

My academic background is in Chemistry but I have had a love for technology since a young age. My exposure to software developement began with my first job after college. I had the chance to work with a technology company where part of my responsibilities was to perform QA on the software. This experience led me to exploring online options for coding schools. After becoming a member of <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#4aaaa5;">Code School</a>, I realized my coding potential and enrolled in this course. I look forward to putting my skills from this class to use for a long time to come.
